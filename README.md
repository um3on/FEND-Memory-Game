## Usage

This project used the starter project from Udacity. The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. I changed the project from a static project to an interactive one. This change require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file. Feel free to use this code, and reference me.
